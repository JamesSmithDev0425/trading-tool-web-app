I don't think this qualifies as a README, but I'm going with this for now. More of a whitepaper, maybe.


Trading Tool - Visualizing Price Targets Algorithmically.


About - 

“The market is made by the mind of man, and all the fluctuations of the market and all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Operator, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and plays a stock to his advantage. “ - Richard Wyckoff.

I have a thesis that the crypto markets are largely ran by bots. During times of low funding, the price action of bitcoin seems to follow technical analysis with precision that I don't think is random. The purpose of this tool will allow the trader to feed in a structure, and produce potential price targets without the need for miticulous manual work. 


Motivation - 

Now that most work is remote, my options are far more open than they were before. I always enjoyed Python in college, but the work in my city was dominated by C#. But now we're in a new work from home paradigm, I am pursing learning the tech stack that interests me, which given my love for technical/market analysis, Python is the logical choice. I have always wanted to become more fluent in Linux as well. I want to use this project to pursue those interests, and expand on them as I go. The end result is to build the skills required to feel confident to pursue this tech stack professionally.

Every trader pays a tuition. I am certainly no different. But while the monitary losses hurt, the knowledge gained has been well worth it. The point in which I felt that I was making progress was the point when I shut off all noise, and just stuck my head in the charts myself and grinded for hours to figure it out myself. The times I lose money are when I go on twitter and read some other traders analysis and get shaken out, just to find out mine was correct the whole time. Or, like in the beginning, I would use every indicator possible and overcomplicate things. 

What does this have to do with this project? Well, I am going to apply the same philosophy that has made me a much more successful trader here. I am going to just start from scratch and grind. I'm not going to use every single tool availible to me. I am going to figure it out myself from scratch in order to reenter the workforce with a sense of direction and a marketable skillset that will make up for some of the lost ground of the bumpy start to my career.

Plan and Goals - 

1. Use nothing but a shell and VIM for editing, managing, and navigating the project. Add extensions to VIM as they become needed and the project becomes more complex. Goal: Learn the hard way. Using the absolute basics will force me to really understand what I'm doing as the project gets more complex. 

2. Stick to the docs and stackoverflow, don't veer too far. Example, I plan on using Django to build the backend of this web app. I am hoping to use React or Angular for the front end, and postogreSQL for the database. All of these things I am currently unfamiliar with, but I plan to just figure it out as I go. Goal: Once again, learn the hard way. Pursue the tech stack that interests me by just grinding in that enviornment. Figure out how the pieces fit together without relying on handholding.

3. Execute this plan. I have many more ideas and visions for where this could lead, but scope creep will kill this project. This is the plan. Figure out the rest later.
